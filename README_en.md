<h1>Final Project – Quantum Computer Architecture and Programming</h1>
This project explores quantum-inspired algorithms—classical algorithms designed using principles from quantum computing. While they do not directly utilize quantum phenomena like superposition or entanglement, they adopt concepts from quantum theory to improve the performance of optimization techniques on classical hardware.

These algorithms are particularly useful for solving large-scale, high-complexity computational problems that are challenging for traditional approaches.

In this project, several implementations of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms have been developed and tested. The work analyzes the quantum concepts integrated into these algorithms and evaluates their performance when applied to a real-world optimization problem.

The results demonstrate a significant advantage over classical algorithms, and the project concludes with potential improvements and future directions for enhancing these methods.
